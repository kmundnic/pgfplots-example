# pgfplots-example
A (short) example to create figures using PGFPlots in LaTeX using `Plots.jl` and the `pgfplots()` backed in Julia. Similar code can be used to create figures using [matlab2tikz](https://github.com/matlab2tikz/matlab2tikz) in MATLAB and [tikzplotlib](https://github.com/nschloe/tikzplotlib) in Python.

The `main.tex` file contains examples on what to include in the preamble, how to load the figures, and useful tips and tricks, such  as:
 - Externalizing specific figures
 - Loading data into PGFPlots from CSV files
 - A bash script to automate the externalization of your figures
 
 This repo is not intended as a tutorial, but as a way to get you started.
